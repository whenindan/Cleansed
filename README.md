# Cleansed

Cleansed is an iOS productivity app built with SwiftUI + SwiftData.

It combines:
- Todo management
- Habit tracking with completion history
- Focus groups using Screen Time APIs (FamilyControls + DeviceActivity)
- A Home Screen widget with interactive todo toggles

## Tech Stack

- Swift 5
- SwiftUI
- SwiftData
- WidgetKit + App Intents
- FamilyControls + DeviceActivity (with monitor/report/shield extensions)

## Targets

- `Cleansed/` - Main app
- `TodoWidget/` - Widget extension
- `DeviceActivityMonitorExtension/` - Focus session lifecycle monitor
- `DeviceActivityReportExtension/` - Device activity report scene
- `ShieldActionExtension/` - Shield action hooks
- `ShieldConfigurationExtension/` - Shield UI configuration
- `CleansedTests/` - Unit tests
- `CleansedUITests/` - UI tests

## Core Features

- Todos
  - Create, complete/uncomplete, and delete tasks
  - Shared with widget through App Group storage
- Habits
  - Track completions with history/stat-style views
- Focus
  - Create focus groups to block selected apps/categories
  - Start/stop sessions and display device activity reporting
- Account/Settings
  - Theme toggle
  - Widget appearance customization (size-specific settings)
- Widget
  - Supports interactive todo completion via `ToggleTodoIntent`
  - Supports small/medium/large/extralarge families

## Shared Data and App Groups

The app and extensions use shared `UserDefaults` in App Groups for cross-target data exchange.

Configured app groups in entitlements:
- `group.com.cleansed.shared`
- `group.learn.Cleansed`

`TodoManager` and widget settings use `group.com.cleansed.shared` for todo payload + widget appearance state.

## Requirements

- macOS with Xcode installed
- iOS SDK compatible with the deployment settings in `Cleansed.xcodeproj`
- Apple Developer provisioning/capabilities for:
  - App Groups
  - Family Controls / Device Activity / Managed Settings (for focus blocking features)

## Setup

1. Open `Cleansed.xcodeproj` in Xcode.
2. Select a signing team for all app + extension targets.
3. Verify Signing & Capabilities for each relevant target:
   - App Groups (matching IDs across app/extensions)
   - Family Controls related entitlements
4. Build and run the `Cleansed` scheme on a supported iOS simulator/device.

## Running Tests

From Xcode:
- `Product` -> `Test`

From command line:

```bash
xcodebuild test \
  -project Cleansed.xcodeproj \
  -scheme Cleansed \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15'
```
